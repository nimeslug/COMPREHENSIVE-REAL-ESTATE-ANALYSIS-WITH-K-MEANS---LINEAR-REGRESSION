# COMPREHENSIVE REAL ESTATE ANALYSIS

This project presents a complete data mining workflow applied to real estate data. It combines unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) and supervised learning (Linear Regression), along with essential preprocessing and visualization steps. The aim is to explore data patterns, segment properties, and predict housing prices.

##  Project Structure


---

##  Objectives

- Clean and preprocess real estate data for analysis
- Apply scaling techniques: StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler
- Use K-Means to group similar properties into clusters
- Evaluate cluster quality with silhouette scores
- Build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices
- Visualize clustering results and regression fit

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn  
- **Algorithms**: K-Means Clustering, Linear Regression  
- **Evaluation Metric**: Silhouette Score

##  Sample Analyses

### K-Means Clustering
- Applied on scaled data using different values of `k` (2 and 3)
- Visualized using scatter plots
- Best `k` determined using silhouette score

### Linear Regression
- Model trained to predict house prices using features like size, location, and number of rooms
- Regression line plotted for interpretation
- Model performance assessed visually and numerically
